# 2026-02-12 - InvestIQ Updates

## Morning Work Session (4 AM - 5 AM PST)

### 1. CRE Scan Job Removed
- Stopped the "Framingham CRE Browser Scanner" cron job as requested
- No more daily 9 AM EST property searches

### 2. API Revert
- User wanted detailed criteria numbers back when clicking tickers
- Reverted from cache-based API to live rater
- But then realized the real issue...

### 3. Strict Growth Filter Applied
- Changed top 50 filter to require **BOTH years >= 10% revenue growth**
- Growth score must be >= 15 to qualify
- **79 stocks** now qualify (out of 1,018)
- **939 stocks** filtered out

### 4. Flask Backend Crash
- Issue: Flask server had crashed/stopped
- Restarted it, but then realized the real fix...

### 5. v4.4 Deployed - Website Reads Local Cache
- Created **all_stocks.json** with full criteria breakdown for all 1,012 stocks
- Modified website to read from local JSON file (no API needed)
- Works on qortexai.com (GitHub Pages static hosting)
- RBA now correctly shows: "Sales Growth (2yr): ✓ PASSED (27 pts)"

### Key Decisions
- Website detail view pulls from cached all_stocks.json (not live API)
- Top rankings require strict 2-year revenue growth >= 10% both years
- All stock data pre-calculated and pushed to GitHub for website

### Top 5 (as of this morning)
1. RBA (96) | Growth: 30
2. IBKR (94) | Growth: 26
3. WTM (93) | Growth: 30
4. RNR (92) | Growth: 24
5. HALO (91) | Growth: 15
