# 2026-02-04 — Voice Call Research + Portfolio Day

## Voice Call Setup Task
Dan wants to talk to me via voice call. Research findings:

### OpenClaw Voice-Call Plugin
- **Location:** `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/extensions/voice-call/`
- **Status:** Disabled (needs configuration)
- **Providers supported:** Twilio, Telnyx, Plivo, Mock

### What's needed:
1. **Twilio Account** (or Telnyx/Plivo)
   - Sign up at twilio.com
   - Get a phone number (~$1/month)
   - Get Account SID + Auth Token
   
2. **Public Webhook** for callbacks:
   - Option A: ngrok (free tier works)
   - Option B: Tailscale Funnel
   - Option C: Public URL

3. **Config to add to openclaw.json:**
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "voice-call": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "provider": "twilio",
          "fromNumber": "+1TWILIO_NUMBER",
          "toNumber": "+1DAN_PHONE",
          "twilio": {
            "accountSid": "ACxxxxxxxx",
            "authToken": "TOKEN"
          },
          "tunnel": {
            "provider": "ngrok"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### TODO for morning:
- [ ] Ask Dan if he wants to create Twilio account himself or wants help
- [ ] Once credentials provided, enable plugin
- [ ] Test with mock mode first
- [ ] Set up ngrok tunnel for webhooks

## Portfolio Analysis
Rough day for Dan's portfolio. Estimated -2.5% to -3%.

**Biggest losers:**
- AMD: -17.31%
- PLTR: -11.62%
- NLR: -6.38%
- COPX: -4.57%
- PWR: -4.92%

**Only green:** XLI +0.27%, MSFT +0.72%

**Discussion:** Dan asked about positioning for next 3 months. I suggested trimming concentration in NLR (11.72%) and COPX (12.79%) - both are heavy single-theme bets.

## Email Configuration

## Lesson Learned
**Don't quote market data without fetching it first!** I quoted old Market Pulse data (GLD +6%) when reality was GLD -0.07%. Dan called me out. Always use `fetch_realtime.py` before making claims.

## UI Fixes Done

- Added Enter key support for ticker inputs
