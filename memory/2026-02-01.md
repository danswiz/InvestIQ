# 2026-02-01 — InvestIQ v3.0 "Breakout Hunter" Launch

## Major Bugs Fixed
- **Date Drift Bug:** RS calculation was using fixed 63 trading days instead of calendar 3 months. This caused AMZN to show "high RS" despite being down. Fixed by using exact calendar dates.
- **Industry Strength Upgrade:** Was just checking if sector exists. Now compares sector ETF (XLK, XLY, etc.) performance vs SPY.

## InvestIQ v3.0 Architecture Change
Dan's insight: "Testing a new high should be the best time to buy" — not chasing past momentum.

**New Momentum Criteria (50 pts):**
- Trend Alignment: 5 pts
- Near 52w High: 20 pts (within 5% of high) ← KEY CHANGE
- Tight Base: 10 pts (volatility < 3% over 15 days)
- Volume Dry-up: 5 pts (vol < 50d avg during base)
- Industry Strength: 10 pts (sector ETF vs SPY)

**Quality unchanged (50 pts):**
- Sales/Earnings Growth, Fwd Rev/EPS, Margin, FCF, Debt

## New VUG Leaders (v3.0)
1. MNST (100) - A+
2. GOOGL (90) - A
3. GOOG (90) - A
4. NFLX (75) - B
5. DXCM (75) - B

Notable drops: LRCX, AMAT (were #1-2) now lower because they're extended, not in tight bases.

## In Progress
- Adding TradingView chart widget to webapp (Dan requested clickable ticker → chart)

## Key Files Modified
- `skills/market-analyst/rater.py` — Added c18_near_high, c19_tight_base, c20_vol_dryup, fixed c2_rs and c9_industry
- `invest_iq/app.py` — Updated weights to v3.0 Breakout system
- `invest_iq/templates/index.html` — Working on chart integration

## Lessons Learned
- Fixed row-based date calculations are dangerous (calendar drift)
- Dan's investing style: Quality Growth at breakout points, not momentum chasing
- "Tight base near highs" > "big 3-month return"
