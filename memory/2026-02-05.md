# 2026-02-05 — Model Optimization & Bot Migration

## Model Routing Strategy
- **Optimized Model Chain:** Switched primary model to **Kimi K2.5** for snap replies and routine work. 
- **Deep Reasoning:** Set **Claude Opus 4.5** as the first fallback for complex analysis and investment tasks.
- **Safety Net:** Kept **Gemini Flash** as the tertiary fallback.
- **Goal:** Balance speed and costs while reserving heavy reasoning for high-conviction work.

## Telegram Bot Migration
- **New Bot Activated:** Successfully migrated to a new Telegram bot (Token: `8120674109:AAG...`).
- **Multi-Bot Attempt:** Tried to configure two simultaneous bots, but the Gateway schema currently limits the Telegram plugin to one active token.
- **Status:** Currently operating on the new bot. Original token (`8014185362:AAFY...`) is preserved in memory for future restoration if requested.

## Market Analysis: MU & AI Infrastructure
- **MU Deep Dive:** Analyzed Micron Technology. Noted its role as an HBM3E powerhouse for NVIDIA Blackwell chips. 
- **Relative Strength:** MU finished green (+0.85%) during a broad QQQ sell-off.
- **Divergence Scan:** Identified **ARM (+5.70%)** and **PWR (+2.83%)** as elite "smart money" leaders holding up during the liquidation event.

## Automated Alpha Report
- **Status:** The first Daily Alpha Report was successfully generated via Kimi (after Opus rate limits) and emailed to `dbirru@gmail.com`.
- **Finding:** Today's VIX spike (+16%) and the crypto/gold flush confirm a broad de-leveraging regime.
