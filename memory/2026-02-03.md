# 2026-02-03 — Model Switch & InvestIQ Cloud Fixes

## Model Configuration Change
- **Default model switched to Gemini Flash** for faster routing/everyday tasks
- **Opus reserved for coding** — Dan's preference: "Gemini Flash for routing, Opus for coding"
- Reason: I was "going dead" because Opus API calls were timing out (2+ minutes), requiring Dan to restart the gateway manually

## InvestIQ Cloud Deployment (www.qortexai.com)
- **Repo:** github.com/danswiz/InvestIQ (branch: main)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (custom domain: www.qortexai.com)
- **Current Issues:**
  1. **News Relay broken:** All news items returning `null` (title, link, publisher)
  2. **Ratings not displaying:** Frontend can't reach `/api/rate/` endpoint properly
  3. Root cause: `yfinance` news fetch fails in Vercel's serverless environment (IP restrictions)

## Fixes In Progress
- Need to add robust error handling for news fetch
- Need to ensure API routing works on Vercel
- Dan explicitly said: "Forget local access" — focus only on GitHub/Vercel deployment

## Gateway Restarts Today
- 4:38 AM PST — SIGTERM (Dan's manual restart)
- 5:39 AM PST — SIGTERM (Dan's manual restart after config change)
- Both were due to perceived "dead" state from slow Opus responses

## Market Pulse
- Pre-market report sent at 8:00 AM
- Top breakout candidates: VMC, MPWR (Grade A)
- Dan's Grid-to-Chip basket (PWR, VRT, GEV) showing strength
