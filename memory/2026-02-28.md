# 2026-02-28 — Major Rater Upgrade Day

## Rater v4.4 → v5.0 Upgrade
- Added 5 improvements: earnings acceleration, real RS, dynamic sectors, graduated revenue, fixed vol compression
- **CRITICAL BUG FOUND**: v4.4 awarded points for FAILED criteria (breakout=✗ still gave +22pts). Fixed — points only when passed=True.
- Score distribution now realistic: NVDA 43/C (was 83/A with bug), NVT 98/A, LLY 79/A
- Filter tightened: both years >=10% rev + score>=55 → 94 top stocks (was 372 too loose, was 65 in v4.4)

## Rotation Catcher v1.0 — NEW
- Separate module: 6 signals (RS divergence, earnings revisions, valuation gap, Weinstein stage breakout, volume accumulation, sector momentum)
- Originally had 7 signals with Mag7 weakness — Dan correctly said remove it (not universal)
- Redistributed weights across 6 signals (22/17/17/22/11/11)
- Auto-detects sector ETF, aggressive caching
- Test: MU 67.3, NVT 68.5 (Rotation Watch), GOOGL 37.7 (Weak)

## Watchlist Rewrite
- Was: 46 individual yfinance calls (~90 sec)
- Now: reads scores from all_stocks.json DB + 1 bulk yfinance call for live prices (~3 sec)
- Added rotation_score column
- Sub-scores (T/G/Q/C) + moonshot + rotation all visible

## Website (qortexai.com)
- Added sub-score breakdown (T:X G:X Q:X C:X) under score
- Added Moonshot column
- Added Rotation column with color coding
- All pushed to GitHub Pages

## Full Scan Status
- Running update_web_scan.py with rotation (1033 stocks, ~10 min)
- Had SIGKILL issues — stripped criteria from all_stocks.json to reduce memory
- Scan in progress as of 2:59 PM EST
