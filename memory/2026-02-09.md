## Created New Skill: Executive Research

**What:** Built a complete OpenClaw skill for researching executives and generating consulting prep reports.

**Location:** `skills/executive-research/`

**Contents:**
- SKILL.md with full research workflow and instructions
- references/research-sources.md with search strategies and source hierarchy
- scripts/executive_research.py helper for generating search queries
- assets/report-template.html professional HTML report template

**Use Case:** Preparing for consulting meetings, pitches, and engagements with C-suite executives, VPs, and decision-makers.

**Trigger Phrases:** "research executive", "prep report for [name]", "executive briefing", "consulting prep for [person]"

**Key Features:**
- Researches across LinkedIn, company sites, news, podcasts, conferences
- Generates structured HTML briefing report
- Includes career trajectory, company context, network connections
- Provides consulting engagement angles and talking points
- Preparation checklist included

## Fixed Cron Job Delivery Issue

**Problem:** Cron jobs configured to deliver to Telegram instead of email, despite saying "email" in descriptions.

**Fix:** Updated `/Users/dansmacmini/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` to correct delivery configuration for:
- Daily Alpha Report → now delivers to dbirru@gmail.com
- Market Pulse Pre-Market → now delivers to dbirru@gmail.com

**Note:** Cron tool still has timeout bug when communicating with Gateway, but jobs themselves are running correctly. Can manage via direct JSON editing if needed.

## Research: Recursive Language Models (RLM)

**Paper:** arXiv:2512.24601 by Alex Zhang et al., MIT (Dec 2025)

**Key Insight:** Treat long prompts as external environment, not direct neural input. Model writes Python code to manipulate context and recursively delegates to child agents.

**Performance:**
- Scales to 10M+ tokens (100x typical context)
- +28-33% on OOLONG benchmark
- 58% F1 on OOLONG-Pairs (vs <0.1% baseline)
- Trained RLM-Qwen3-8B: +28.3% improvement with only 1,000 samples

**Architecture:**
- `context` variable contains full prompt in REPL
- `rlm_agent(query, context)` spawns recursive child agents
- Metadata-only turns prevent context pollution

**ADK Implementation:** Liam Connell created Google ADK version with lazy file loading and parallelism extensions.

## Platforms Researched

**Google Antigravity:**
- New AI-powered developer platform from Google
- Features: AI coding agents, editor integration, REST API, plugins
- Target: Enterprise, frontend, full-stack, and professional developers

**Claude Cowork:**
- Anthropic's agentic AI for non-coding knowledge work
- File management, data extraction, document creation, web integration
- macOS only, research preview
- Pricing: Pro ($20) to Enterprise tiers

## User Preferences Reminder

- **Email format:** Always use HTML, never plain text
- **Work email rule:** When told "send to work email", send to BOTH work (dagnachew.birru@quantiphi.com) AND personal (dbirru@gmail.com)
- **Default email:** Personal only unless explicitly specified
