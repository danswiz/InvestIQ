**Lagging:** Financials, Consumer Discretionary

### Recession
**Leading:** Utilities, Staples, Healthcare
**Lagging:** Cyclicals, Tech, Financials

## Current Position Assessment (Feb 2026)

**Where we are:** Late cycle / early recession watch
**Evidence:**
- Yield curve un-inverting (recession signal)
- Credit spreads widening
- Leading indicators declining
- But employment still strong

**Implications:**
- Defensive sectors outperforming (Utilities, Staples)
- Growth/AI trade still working but narrowing
- Quality matters more than growth

## Industry Strength Within Sectors

### Semiconductors (Strong)
- AI chips: Very strong (demand > supply)
- Memory: Cyclical but structural AI demand
- Equipment: Strong (reshoring capex)
- Auto/industrial: Weak (inventory correction)

### Software (Mixed)
- AI infrastructure: Strong
- Cybersecurity: Strong
- SaaS (high growth): Weak (multiple compression)
- Legacy: Weak (AI disruption)

### Regional Banks (Mixed)

## Warning: Sector ETF Bias

Popular ETFs create crowding:
- QQQ (tech concentration)
- XLF (big bank bias)
- XLK (FAANG dominance)

Consider:
- Equal-weight sector ETFs (RSP instead of SPY)
- Active management for dispersion
- Individual stock selection within sectors

## Integration with Stock Selection

**Best setups:**
1. Strong sector + Strong stock within sector = Momentum
2. Weak sector + Strong stock = Contrarian opportunity
3. Strong sector + Weak stock = Avoid (relative underperformance)

**Example:**
- AI trend (strong) + VRT (strong within data center infra) = Buy
- Regional banks (weak) + FNB (strong within weak sector) = Wait or small position
