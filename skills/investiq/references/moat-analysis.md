# Moat Analysis Framework

Use this reference when the user asks for competitive advantage, moat assessment, or durability analysis of a business.

## What is a Moat?

A moat is a sustainable competitive advantage that protects a company's profits from competitors. Durability is key — temporary advantages are not moats.

## Types of Moats

### 1. Network Effects
**Definition:** Value increases as more users join the network
**Examples:** 
- Visa/Mastercard (more merchants → more cardholders)
- Microsoft Windows (more users → more developers)
- Facebook/Meta (more friends → more engagement)
**Assessment:** Is the network self-reinforcing? Is switching difficult?

### 2. High Switching Costs
**Definition:** Expensive/difficult for customers to switch to competitor
**Examples:**
- Enterprise software (Salesforce, SAP) — training, integration, data migration
- TSMC chip manufacturing — $B+ to redesign for different process
- Allison Transmission — vehicle designs locked in
**Assessment:** What would it cost in time/money/risk to switch?

### 3. Brand Strength
**Definition:** Pricing power from perceived differentiation
**Examples:**
- Coca-Cola — can charge premium for sugar water
- Hermès/LVMH — luxury pricing power
- Nike — brand loyalty in commodity market
**Assessment:** Can they raise prices without losing customers?

### 4. Cost Advantages
**Definition:** Structurally lower costs than competitors
**Types:**
- **Scale:** Walmart, Amazon — volume purchasing power
- **Location:** Saudi Aramco — cheapest oil extraction
- **Process:** Toyota — lean manufacturing expertise
- **Access:** Pilbara Minerals — best lithium deposits
**Assessment:** Are costs truly structural or replicable?

### 5. Regulatory/IP Moats
**Definition:** Legal barriers to competition
**Examples:**
- Pharmaceuticals (patents) — 20-year exclusivity
- Utilities (franchises) — government-granted monopolies
- Halozyme (ENHANZE) — proprietary enzyme platform
**Assessment:** How long does protection last? What happens when it expires?

### 6. Cornered Resources
**Definition:** Exclusive access to scarce resource
**Examples:**
- De Beers (historically) — diamond mines
- ASML — only EUV lithography machines
- TSMC — leading-edge fab capacity
**Assessment:** Is the resource truly scarce? Can substitutes emerge?

## Moat Durability Assessment

### Wide Moat (Strong)
- Lasts 20+ years
- Multiple reinforcing advantages
- Hard to replicate even with capital
- Examples: TSMC, Microsoft, Coca-Cola

### Narrow Moat (Moderate)
- Lasts 5-15 years
- One strong advantage
- Replicable but takes time
- Examples: Micron (oligopoly), Vertiv (heritage)

### No Moat (Weak)
- No sustainable advantage
- Competes on price
- Easily disrupted
- Examples: Most commodity businesses

## Analysis Framework

When analyzing a stock's moat, answer:

1. **What is the primary moat type?** (network, switching costs, brand, cost, IP)
2. **How durable is it?** (years of protection remaining)
3. **Is it widening or narrowing?** (trend direction)
4. **What would erode it?** (technology, regulation, competition)
5. **Does it translate to ROIC?** (high returns on invested capital)

## Red Flags (Fake Moats)

- **First-mover advantage alone** — not a moat without network effects
- **Good management** — can leave; not structural
- **Technology leadership** — unless protected by IP/switching costs
- **Size alone** — unless it creates cost advantages

## Moat Destruction Warning Signs

Watch for:
- New entrants gaining share
- Pricing pressure
- Customer churn increasing
- ROIC declining
- Commoditization of product
- Regulatory changes
- Technology shifts

## Integration with 10X Potential

For 10X returns, you need:
1. **Wide moat** that survives growth phase
2. **Large TAM** that can support 10X revenue
3. **Reinvestment runway** — moat allows profitable expansion

Narrow moat companies can 10X during growth but often lose gains to competition.
